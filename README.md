# SBA 307 - Joe's Photography

A primarily HTML/CSS template base code (with a hint of Javascript) for a portfolio website for my friend Joe and his photography.

Website is intended to show case his work and be able to allow visitors to request commissions from him. 

# Coding Languages Used

A mixture of HTML/CSS and a small piece of a custom Javascript function (used for the navigation drop down menu). 

Used various selectors and pseduo selectors and elements to meet the CSS requirements of the SBA. Also used a singular external style sheet for all three pages while utilizing internal styling for elements that were unique to that page. 

# Long Term Objectives

- Add camera meta data to each photo (iso, camera model it was taken with, resolution, etc.)
- An actually functional commission request form. 
- Better responsiveness and simplification of overall aesthetic. 
- Dark and light mode functionality for accessibility. 
- More DOM manipulation with Javascript in order to make the site as a whole more dynamic and responsive.
